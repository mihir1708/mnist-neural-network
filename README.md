# MNIST Neural Network Classification

A notebook-based project that builds and evaluates a neural network for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

---

## Overview

This project walks through the process of training a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation within a Jupyter Notebook workflow.

The focus is on understanding the end-to-end pipeline of a supervised learning task using a standard benchmark dataset.

## What the Project Does

* Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
* Reshapes input data and applies one-hot encoding to labels
* Visualizes sample images from the training set
* Builds a neural network model for multi-class classification
* Trains the model and evaluates its performance

---

## Tools Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Neural network / deep learning library

## Notes

This notebook focuses on implementing and understanding a neural network workflow using a well-known dataset. It is intended as a clear, self-contained example of image classification rather than an optimized or production-ready model.
